# WSIPP SNG CBS Cost_model
WSIPP-developed cost model used by WA legislative staff and the Washington Student Achievement Council to estimate the costs of Washington's State Need Grant (SNG) and College Bound Scholarship (CBS) programs

The original model was created by Danielle Fumia and Michael Hirsch at the Washington State Institute for Public Policy. I provided a series of contributions to the model, expanding its features and functionality.

The data has been fully de-identified to protect the privacy of Washington's students. All individual-level data has been removed.

The file format is MS Excel.
